# Current session handoff

Last updated 2026-09-21 for R147–R158 (UTC 2026-09-22).
**Mac `fire.lan` retains ownership.** R155 explicitly confirms the PC never
started work; the earlier published PC handoff was not received and is now
superseded. The user ran the [MacPorts launcher](packaging/macports/README.md):
`povray @3.7.0.8_6` is active, and its sphere test passed both intersections
and subsequent visual inspection. Effective flags are `-Os -fno-fast-math`,
not the intended `-O2`. Exact recompilation scope is unknown; R154 accepts this
repair without another build merely to resolve timing. R158 explicitly
authorizes publishing these notes before a fresh chat on this Mac. Publication
is prepared here; actual delivery commit/result follows in the final response
and Git history. Mac ownership is retained, not transferred to PC.
The blank-render cause is established: MacPorts POV-Ray 3.7.0.8's fast-math
build mishandles infinity sentinels in camera defaults. A conservative build
of the same source renders the unchanged sphere, beads example, official torus
and project frames 1, 120 and 240 correctly. Re-enabling fast-math in only the
scene parser reproduces the fault; restoring conservative math restores the
byte-identical working binary. [Diagnosis, evidence and build recipe](docs/rendering/POVRAY_MAC_BUILD_DIAGNOSIS.md).

The user's `beads1.jpg` correctly shows beads on an intentional white background.
The faulty revision-5 beads render was entirely black, with no geometry. The
installed `/opt/local/bin/povray` is now revision 6; revision 5 is retained
inactive. The earlier temporary executable remains diagnostic history, not the
default renderer. No movie, FEM or physical work ran. The first package attempt
stopped at an inherited `openexr` build conflict; the user deactivated it and
retried successfully. R157 records the user's subsequent reactivation;
read-only verification confirms `openexr @3.4.15_0` and `openexr2 @2.5.10_0`
are both active alongside POV-Ray revision 6. OpenEXR restoration is complete;
the launcher did not do it automatically.
Continue to run POV-Ray outside the restricted agent sandbox. Keep the existing
empty user configuration file; no further configuration edits were needed.

Next: finish the installed-renderer checks **on this Mac**, following the
[single next task](#next-task). R158 recommends a fresh chat at this completed
checkpoint; Luna/medium is sufficient. `/new` is not a guaranteed speedup.
The necessary state is recorded here rather than relying on the old chat. No platform
switch is needed for Mac-local installation checks. Do not start PC repository
work until a new explicit handoff is prepared and delivered; no concurrent writers.
Project camera/material/trajectory changes are unnecessary for this fix.
The portable trajectory checker remains a saved-data validity check, not a
runtime or scientific certificate; [practical supervision policy](docs/realizability/B2_MONITOR_PRACTICAL_SUPERVISION_POLICY.md)
and physical-work limits remain unchanged.

## Owner and checkout

| Field | Current value |
|---|---|
| Owner | Mac `fire.lan`, Darwin/arm64, per R155 explicit clarification; PC never started. |
| Checkout | `/Users/rharris/git/navier-stokes-vortex-lab`. |
| Branch/upstream | `main` / `origin/main` |
| Starting state | R155 clean fast-forward pull was up to date at `4101af9`. R158 fresh fetch confirms HEAD/origin/main unchanged; empty stashes. Six known metadata edits deliberately reconciled under explicit publication authorization; no pull over dirty work. |
| Interpreter | `/Users/rharris/miniconda3/envs/navier-stokes-vortex-b1/bin/python`, CPython 3.12.13 |
| Other owner/process | User confirms no PC work started. This is not inferred from local Git; no remote PC operation was performed. |
| Task processes | User-managed package operation and sphere smoke test completed. R155–R158 perform metadata/checks/publication only; no new compiler/render task. Agent stops after delivery; no background task is being left to continue. |
| Delivery state | Prior bundle/handoff delivered as `4101af9`. R158 explicitly authorizes publication of R147–R158 notes; prepared for scoped commit/push. Actual delivery hash/result follows in final response/Git history. Failure retains Mac responsibility and pending publication. |

## Current result and limits

R103 removes recursive infrastructure certification while preserving process
safeguards, observed accounting, cleanup and incomplete-result refusal. R104
requires Mac usability, small increments tied to useful work, and deferral of
optional platform/benchmark features. Ordinary disclosed OS trust is accepted.
No live failure rate or Mac capability has been measured.

R105 source review found a useful, independent first increment:
`make_trajectories.py` writes every frame but only checks finiteness of final
in-memory coordinates. A separate reader can validate all saved frames before
POV-Ray uses them. It needs no subprocess launcher, OS adapter, watchdog or
R097 witness changes. Its claim is saved-data validity, never runtime/resource
certification or physical correctness. The generator also deletes matching
output files; the new checker must be read-only on its inputs.

R106 implemented that reader in `check_trajectories.py` with a standard-library,
line-bounded parser for only the declarations emitted by `write_include`.
It checks exact frame/bead inventories, required declarations, finite values,
increasing `SimTime`, radius and z bounds with 1e-9 tolerance, extrema and
motion status. It refuses malformed or oversized files, preserves inputs and
protects input paths from report writes. Human output and optional new JSON
reports identify pass/fail and actionable errors. Six focused tests pass under
Python 3.12.13, including corrupt-input, tolerance, source-preservation and
CLI cases. No trajectory integration, rendering, encoding, FEM, Mac, live or
monitor work ran.

Historical scientific documents, monitor contracts, fixture evidence and budgets
remain unchanged. Practical OS supervision remains deferred, not certified.
The future PC monitor suite retains 180 s (30 + ten 12 s + 30), 768 MiB whole
Linux unit/no swap/32 PIDs, 512 MiB sampled workload RSS and <=128 MiB native
working set. Physical limits remain 180 s / 1536 MiB, q64/q96 unused, B2 accuracy
failed. No trajectory, fixture, native/live, FEM, render or encode work ran here.

R109 generated the existing 240-frame/500-bead trajectory on Mac Python
3.12.13 and the saved-data checker passed all 240 frames. `SimTime` increased
from 0 to 7.966666667 s; motion was observed; radius extrema were
0.0127997550102..0.737911610466 and z extrema were -0.98..0.98. The first,
middle and last include files were present and readable. The installed
`/opt/local/bin/povray` failed even on a minimal 64x64 scene: the reproducible
script `reproduce_povray_mac.sh` timed out after 10 s and returned 137 after
`gtimeout --signal=KILL`, with macOS service-connection warnings only. No
separated-frame inspection or encoding ran. This is a renderer/tooling failure,
not evidence against the trajectory data or a scientific result.

R110 tested the suggested lowercase `-d` headless switch in
`reproduce_povray_mac.sh`. The minimal 64x64 scene still timed out after 10 s,
returned 137 under `gtimeout --signal=KILL`, emitted no PNG, and produced the
same macOS service-connection warnings. Thus the failure is not explained by
the uppercase/lowercase display switch used in the earlier attempt.

R111 corrected the minimal scene's missing camera angle (`angle 45`), after
which POV-Ray parsed the scene but still hung until the 10 s kill. The project
scene also hung under the same lowercase-`-d` command. The reproduction now
distinguishes scene syntax from the remaining MacPorts/runtime failure.

R113 records a successful interactive Mac reproduction reported by the user,
with only the `assumed_gamma` warning, and adds the explicit gamma setting.
The same invocation from this restricted agent environment still timed out;
this discrepancy is not treated as a Mac capability claim. Interactive project
rendering remains the next bounded check.

R114 tested environment, startup, headless-flag, output-path and project-scene
variants in the restricted agent sandbox. All POV-Ray variants were killed by
the short diagnostic timeout with no PNG, while temporary writes worked and
the environment exposed an XQuartz `DISPLAY` value but denied process
listing. R115 prepared a no-timeout interactive launcher; it was not run here.

R116 launched a sandbox POV-Ray child and attempted `sample`; the child was
alive, but macOS refused inspection with the explicit “try running with sudo”
message. The child was terminated and cleaned up. This confirms that useful
backtrace collection is blocked by sandbox observability permissions.

R120 also attempted a bounded `lldb` attach inside the sandbox. It reported
`attach failed: no such process`, while `sample` again refused process
inspection. No usable backtrace was obtained; no SIP change was attempted.

R126 ran the minimal reproduction through elevated host execution rather than
the restricted sandbox with a 300 s timeout. It exited 0, rendered the 64x64
PNG in approximately 0.001 s with graphic display off, and emitted no
LaunchServices warnings. This confirms the timeout was sandbox-specific. The
optional POV-Ray configuration file was absent, but rendering succeeded.

R128 externally rendered frames 1, 120 and 240 after fixing the animation
selection and three-digit output naming in the bundled script. All three
renders exited 0 in approximately 0.016–0.019 s at 640x360, but inspection
found uniform pale images; frame 1 signal statistics were constant across all
pixels. No movie or ffprobe check ran because visible scene output was not
established.

R130 externally ran bundled visibility probes. Full, overlay, tracer-only and
known-sphere camera variants all exited 0 but produced background-only images;
POV-Ray reported zero successful plane, bounding-box and sphere intersections.
Display-enabled mode and reversed/canonical camera variants did not change
that. The evidence rules out the saved trajectory and transparent tank as the
sole cause, but does not justify changing project scene semantics yet.

R131 confirmed that `/Users/rharris/.povray/3.7/povray.conf` and its parent
directories were absent, then created only the empty user configuration file.
The existing external minimal reproduction was rerun with a 300-second bound:
it exited 0, emitted a valid 64x64 PNG, and no longer printed the missing-user-
configuration warning. POV-Ray still reports the expected MacPorts
unofficial-build notice; its trace time was approximately 0.001 seconds.
No project-scene movie, ffprobe, FEM, physical or broad benchmark work ran.

R132 removed the stale diagnostic shell and its child `povray -version`
process after verifying their exact PIDs. A follow-up process check found both
gone; no unrelated process was targeted.

R133 selected the next execution boundary: GPT-5.6 Luna/medium on the Mac host
from a normal user Terminal/external execution context. The next bounded task
is one centered-object POV-Ray comparison, followed by one project frame only
if that object is visibly rendered. Astra/high is not warranted unless the
comparison creates a model/format or unexpected renderer-build decision.

R134 ran that centered-object comparison. A canonical red sphere and camera
produced a valid PNG with status 0, but POV-Ray reported zero successful sphere
intersections and inspection found only the background. This is now an
unexpected renderer/build-level failure even outside the restricted sandbox;
the project scene and saved trajectory should not be changed in response.

R117 verified the execution environment as macOS 26.6.2/Darwin arm64 on
`fire.lan`, user `rharris`, with ordinary command execution and repository/tmp
write access. The tool sandbox denies `.git` writes, `ps`, unrestricted
`sysctl`, and `sample` process inspection. These restrictions explain why
agent-side POV-Ray backtraces are unavailable.

## Next task

On **Mac `fire.lan`**, finish the installed POV-Ray validation: beads and project
frames 1/120/240. OpenEXR restoration is verified in R157. This session can perform the
bounded step; **GPT-5.6 Luna/medium** is sufficient for a fresh session or model
switch. Stay on Mac because that is where the replacement executable, libraries
and build evidence reside. No second session or model switch was launched.

R158 reconciles and publishes the preceding metadata notes, then stops. In the
fresh Mac chat, verify delivery and a clean worktree, and follow the clean
synchronization/start-publication requirements in the
[session protocol](docs/workflow/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md) and
[track rules](docs/workflow/TRACK_RULES.md) when the user says **Continue**.
If any unpublished work remains, preserve/reconcile it instead of pulling over
it. R158 itself does not launch the next renderer task. Keep the prior final
completion/“worked for” message, then `/new`, `/status` and the supplied excerpts
under the existing reporting procedure; do not invent a new-session excerpt.

1. Check `port installed openexr openexr2 povray` for unchanged package state:
   OpenEXR 3.4.15_0, openexr2 2.5.10_0 and POV-Ray 3.7.0.8_6 are now active.
   No further activation, forced deactivation or broad package upgrade is needed.
2. Verify installed `/opt/local/bin/povray` against the recorded hash below.
   The canonical sphere already passed intersections and visual inspection
   with that binary; repeat only if executable/configuration changed.
3. Check existing saved positions read-only with Python 3.12 and
   `check_trajectories.py`. Do not regenerate or overwrite them. Read the beads
   scene/reference without editing that separate checkout; use fresh output
   paths outside it. Render beads at 160x120/two threads, then project frame 1,
   then inspect frames 1/120/240 at 320x180/two threads. Bound each render to
   30 seconds and run outside the restricted agent sandbox. Preserve the
   full 1–240 animation range with `+SF`/`+EF` selection, without retiming.
4. Stop after those checks and record results honestly. No movie, trajectory
   changes, FEM, physical, benchmark or new compilation is part of this step.
   Stop on missing input, timeout, invisible geometry or unexplained failure;
   no repeated sweep or scene workaround. A contiguous preview can follow in
   a later task, with a new PC handoff only if the user chooses that machine.

### Note for the next Mac session

Installed revision 6 passed the red-sphere smoke test and visual inspection.
Effective flags are `-Os -fno-fast-math`; the intended recipe's `-O2` was not
effective. Do not claim all files were recompiled: the retained phase log spans
about 81 seconds, the detailed compiler log was cleaned, and the user remembers
a particularly slow large C++ file that has not been identified. R154 accepts
the working result; do not rebuild just to answer that historical question.
If another build becomes necessary, retain verbose commands and review flag
ordering, OpenEXR preflight/restoration and log retention before running it.

Successful local run directory:
`/Users/rharris/Library/Logs/navier-stokes-vortex-lab/povray-rebuild/run.DQa0eT/`.
Its `status.txt` still says visual inspection pending; that automatic status
was followed by successful agent visual inspection without rewriting the log.
SHA-256 bindings checked in R155:

- Installed executable: `679bf4a83ba552bfc7c55e0e0b44f2b0580312c837785551fef8e2d1974ed795`.
- `sphere.png`: `d56943930c28e762cb438431bf3605c49f162d291c7da0a939db620c489f94be`.
- `build.log`: `f4e7009098456ec6ac17d4705bbb8043188c5b8a162f13950894e495fe9bcfc2`.

The OpenAI Docs check in R156 confirms
[Luna's medium reasoning option and cost-sensitive role](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-luna).
The task-fit recommendation is judgment, not an account-access check. Existing
Astra/high escalation guidance remains for a new build/model/format decision,
not for routine render checks or the accepted historical timing uncertainty.
