# Current session handoff

Last updated 2026-09-21 for R136–R138 (completion UTC 2026-09-22).
The blank-render cause is established: MacPorts POV-Ray 3.7.0.8's fast-math
build mishandles infinity sentinels in camera defaults. A conservative build
of the same source renders the unchanged sphere, beads example, official torus
and project frames 1, 120 and 240 correctly. Re-enabling fast-math in only the
scene parser reproduces the fault; restoring conservative math restores the
byte-identical working binary. [Diagnosis, evidence and build recipe](docs/rendering/POVRAY_MAC_BUILD_DIAGNOSIS.md).

The user's `beads1.jpg` correctly shows beads on an intentional white background.
The faulty new beads render was entirely black, with no geometry. The installed
`/opt/local/bin/povray` remains unchanged. The working temporary executable is
`/tmp/povray-build-diagnosis.JO4kJZ/povray-safe-math`; its SHA-256 is recorded
in the diagnosis. No system installation, movie, FEM or physical work ran.
Continue to run POV-Ray outside the restricted agent sandbox. Keep the existing
empty user configuration file; no further configuration edits were needed.

Next: **Luna/medium on the Mac** makes the conservative renderer durable and
rechecks the small scenes, following the [single next task](#next-task).
Project camera/material/trajectory changes are unnecessary for this fix.
The portable trajectory checker remains a saved-data validity check, not a
runtime or scientific certificate; [practical supervision policy](docs/realizability/B2_MONITOR_PRACTICAL_SUPERVISION_POLICY.md)
and physical-work limits remain unchanged.

## Current result and limits

R103 removes recursive infrastructure certification while preserving process
safeguards, observed accounting, cleanup and incomplete-result refusal. R104
requires Mac usability, small increments tied to useful work, and deferral of
optional platform/benchmark features. Ordinary disclosed OS trust is accepted.
No live failure rate or Mac capability has been measured.

R105 source review found a useful, independent first increment:
`make_trajectories.py` writes every frame but only checks finiteness of final
in-memory coordinates. A separate reader can validate all saved frames before
POV-Ray uses them. It needs no subprocess launcher, OS adapter, watchdog or
R097 witness changes. Its claim is saved-data validity, never runtime/resource
certification or physical correctness. The generator also deletes matching
output files; the new checker must be read-only on its inputs.

R106 implemented that reader in `check_trajectories.py` with a standard-library,
line-bounded parser for only the declarations emitted by `write_include`.
It checks exact frame/bead inventories, required declarations, finite values,
increasing `SimTime`, radius and z bounds with 1e-9 tolerance, extrema and
motion status. It refuses malformed or oversized files, preserves inputs and
protects input paths from report writes. Human output and optional new JSON
reports identify pass/fail and actionable errors. Six focused tests pass under
Python 3.12.13, including corrupt-input, tolerance, source-preservation and
CLI cases. No trajectory integration, rendering, encoding, FEM, Mac, live or
monitor work ran.

Historical scientific documents, monitor contracts, fixture evidence and budgets
remain unchanged. Practical OS supervision remains deferred, not certified.
The future PC monitor suite retains 180 s (30 + ten 12 s + 30), 768 MiB whole
Linux unit/no swap/32 PIDs, 512 MiB sampled workload RSS and <=128 MiB native
working set. Physical limits remain 180 s / 1536 MiB, q64/q96 unused, B2 accuracy
failed. No trajectory, fixture, native/live, FEM, render or encode work ran here.

R109 generated the existing 240-frame/500-bead trajectory on Mac Python
3.12.13 and the saved-data checker passed all 240 frames. `SimTime` increased
from 0 to 7.966666667 s; motion was observed; radius extrema were
0.0127997550102..0.737911610466 and z extrema were -0.98..0.98. The first,
middle and last include files were present and readable. The installed
`/opt/local/bin/povray` failed even on a minimal 64x64 scene: the reproducible
script `reproduce_povray_mac.sh` timed out after 10 s and returned 137 after
`gtimeout --signal=KILL`, with macOS service-connection warnings only. No
separated-frame inspection or encoding ran. This is a renderer/tooling failure,
not evidence against the trajectory data or a scientific result.

R110 tested the suggested lowercase `-d` headless switch in
`reproduce_povray_mac.sh`. The minimal 64x64 scene still timed out after 10 s,
returned 137 under `gtimeout --signal=KILL`, emitted no PNG, and produced the
same macOS service-connection warnings. Thus the failure is not explained by
the uppercase/lowercase display switch used in the earlier attempt.

R111 corrected the minimal scene's missing camera angle (`angle 45`), after
which POV-Ray parsed the scene but still hung until the 10 s kill. The project
scene also hung under the same lowercase-`-d` command. The reproduction now
distinguishes scene syntax from the remaining MacPorts/runtime failure.

R113 records a successful interactive Mac reproduction reported by the user,
with only the `assumed_gamma` warning, and adds the explicit gamma setting.
The same invocation from this restricted agent environment still timed out;
this discrepancy is not treated as a Mac capability claim. Interactive project
rendering remains the next bounded check.

R114 tested environment, startup, headless-flag, output-path and project-scene
variants in the restricted agent sandbox. All POV-Ray variants were killed by
the short diagnostic timeout with no PNG, while temporary writes worked and
the environment exposed an XQuartz `DISPLAY` value but denied process
listing. R115 prepared a no-timeout interactive launcher; it was not run here.

R116 launched a sandbox POV-Ray child and attempted `sample`; the child was
alive, but macOS refused inspection with the explicit “try running with sudo”
message. The child was terminated and cleaned up. This confirms that useful
backtrace collection is blocked by sandbox observability permissions.

R120 also attempted a bounded `lldb` attach inside the sandbox. It reported
`attach failed: no such process`, while `sample` again refused process
inspection. No usable backtrace was obtained; no SIP change was attempted.

R126 ran the minimal reproduction through elevated host execution rather than
the restricted sandbox with a 300 s timeout. It exited 0, rendered the 64x64
PNG in approximately 0.001 s with graphic display off, and emitted no
LaunchServices warnings. This confirms the timeout was sandbox-specific. The
optional POV-Ray configuration file was absent, but rendering succeeded.

R128 externally rendered frames 1, 120 and 240 after fixing the animation
selection and three-digit output naming in the bundled script. All three
renders exited 0 in approximately 0.016–0.019 s at 640x360, but inspection
found uniform pale images; frame 1 signal statistics were constant across all
pixels. No movie or ffprobe check ran because visible scene output was not
established.

R130 externally ran bundled visibility probes. Full, overlay, tracer-only and
known-sphere camera variants all exited 0 but produced background-only images;
POV-Ray reported zero successful plane, bounding-box and sphere intersections.
Display-enabled mode and reversed/canonical camera variants did not change
that. The evidence rules out the saved trajectory and transparent tank as the
sole cause, but does not justify changing project scene semantics yet.

R131 confirmed that `/Users/rharris/.povray/3.7/povray.conf` and its parent
directories were absent, then created only the empty user configuration file.
The existing external minimal reproduction was rerun with a 300-second bound:
it exited 0, emitted a valid 64x64 PNG, and no longer printed the missing-user-
configuration warning. POV-Ray still reports the expected MacPorts
unofficial-build notice; its trace time was approximately 0.001 seconds.
No project-scene movie, ffprobe, FEM, physical or broad benchmark work ran.

R132 removed the stale diagnostic shell and its child `povray -version`
process after verifying their exact PIDs. A follow-up process check found both
gone; no unrelated process was targeted.

R133 selected the next execution boundary: GPT-5.6 Luna/medium on the Mac host
from a normal user Terminal/external execution context. The next bounded task
is one centered-object POV-Ray comparison, followed by one project frame only
if that object is visibly rendered. Astra/high is not warranted unless the
comparison creates a model/format or unexpected renderer-build decision.

R134 ran that centered-object comparison. A canonical red sphere and camera
produced a valid PNG with status 0, but POV-Ray reported zero successful sphere
intersections and inspection found only the background. This is now an
unexpected renderer/build-level failure even outside the restricted sandbox;
the project scene and saved trajectory should not be changed in response.

R117 verified the execution environment as macOS 26.6.2/Darwin arm64 on
`fire.lan`, user `rharris`, with ordinary command execution and repository/tmp
write access. The tool sandbox denies `.git` writes, `ps`, unrestricted
`sysctl`, and `sample` process inspection. These restrictions explain why
agent-side POV-Ray backtraces are unavailable.

## Next task

On Mac `fire.lan`, use **GPT-5.6 Luna/medium** to make the verified conservative
POV-Ray build durable using the documented same-release recipe and supported
MacPorts source-build options. Preserve the working installation/configuration
until the replacement has been reviewed and tested; use the ordinary host
approval mechanism for installation writes. Do not silently replace the
MacPorts executable with the temporary binary. If package support or required
dependencies are unclear, stop with a concrete local-install alternative.

Completion checks: confirm effective compiler flags exclude fast-math,
externally render the canonical sphere and beads example, then inspect project
frames 1, 120 and 240 using the durable executable. `POV_RAY` is already
supported by the diagnostic/render scripts. The working temporary binary's
hash and rebuild instructions are in the [diagnosis](docs/rendering/POVRAY_MAC_BUILD_DIAGNOSIS.md);
verify it if reusing it. Do not transfer Mac binaries or assume `/tmp` survives
a machine switch. No source trajectory regeneration is needed.

Stop before movie encoding in that installation task. After durable rendering
is verified, the following bounded task may render a contiguous short sequence,
encode H.264/yuv420p and verify duration, frame rate/count, resolution, codec and
pixel format with `ffprobe`. Do not treat three separated inspection frames as
a 30 fps contiguous animation. No FEM, physical, broad benchmark or supervision
work is authorized by this renderer task.

Recommend Astra/high only for a new compiler/build ambiguity or unexpected
failure; Luna/medium remains suitable for the settled build/recheck. These model
names/levels are available in the user's supplied session snapshot; no model
switch, delegation or automation was performed by this agent.
**Next prompt: Continue.**
