# Continue session ownership records

Append one `STARTED` event after the clean fast-forward pull and request-log
entry, then commit and push it before substantive work. Before final task
staging, append a matching `COMPLETED` event with the outcome and explicit
release state. Do not rewrite prior events or edit this file after the final
push. See the Continue procedure in `AGENTS.md`.

These records coordinate repository owners; Git does not provide a cross-machine
lock and cannot show unpublished work or live processes in another checkout.
An open event must be resumed by its recorded owner or resolved through the
handoff procedure before another owner starts.

Use one paired entry per request, preserving all earlier entries:

```text
## R### — task title
STARTED | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC | PC/WSL or Mac | hostname | OS/architecture
Checkout: ... | Branch/upstream: ... | Starting commit: ...
Task: ...
COMPLETED | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC | outcome: ... | released: yes/no
Changed files: ... | Checks/skips: ... | Evidence: ... | Next task: ...
```

No session has been started by this file's creation. The current R072 request
was a workflow change, not a `Continue` task instruction.
